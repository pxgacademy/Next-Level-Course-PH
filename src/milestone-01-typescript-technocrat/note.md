## What is TypeScript?
**TypeScript** is an **Object Oriented Programming Language** that is built on top of JavaScript with extra features.

## Why should use TypeScript?
### Lacking in JavaScript
 - Dynamically typed language

### When working in a large application with multiple developers
 - Very difficult to manage large codebase
 - Hard to find bugs
 - Catch errors only in runtime

### TypeScript code can be transpiled into older versions of JavaScript

### ðŸŸ¢ Benefits of using TypeScript
- Support older browser
- Type safety
- Increase your productivity
- Less bugs and less testing

|JS types in TS | TS Own Types  |

|Object         | Union         |
|Symbol         | Intersection  |

### ðŸ”´ Drawbacks of using TypeScript 
- Type Complexities
- Limited Library Support
- Over Engineering
- Migration Challenge
